# OPENCLASSROOMS PROJECT 7

Create a searching algorithm in JavaScript

//BRIEF//

The company 'Les Petits Plats' wishes to set up a website in order to reference all these cooking recipes.
I am in charge of the implementation of one of the major functionality of the site. Namely **the search engine**.
This fonctionnality must maintain its fluidity regardless of the amount of data to be sorted and displayed.

The technical objective of my mission is to perform [2] implementations of the main search algorithm in order to compare the performances and choose the most optimized version. The results will be translated into a “feature investigation sheet”.
